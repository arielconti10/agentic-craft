## Where to work next

| Project | Role |
|---------|------|
| **agentic-craft** | Canonical research, pattern pages, registry, and **this conversation** |
| **eve-chat** | Template / proving ground only — compound composer lives there for eve integration |

eve-chat primitives and playgrounds are snapshotted under [`references/eve-chat/`](../references/eve-chat/README.md).

## The reframe (most important)

The Claude Code composer lab **over-weighted one paragraph** from Addy Osmani's July 2026 post — the eight-field "run contract" list under **Risk and Reversibility** — and built four composer variants (Bare / B / C / D) around **contract read-back at Send**.

**Addy's actual spine:**

1. **Two axes** — agency (how far one agent goes) and orchestration (how many agents, how coordinated)
2. **Six levels (L0–L5)** as eras you climb through — assist → bounded task/goal → management-by-exception
3. **Core question** — *what level does this task deserve, and what verification makes that level defensible?*
4. **Contract** — one safeguard among many, not the organizing UI concept

The Claude Code exploration may have been **solving the wrong problem well**: polished contract read-back UI when the open gap is **level selection + verification defensibility + plan→execute transition**.

**Do not pick Bare/B/C/D until the composer problem is reframed.**

## Composer direction — decided 2026-07-05

**Decision: pursue B + C.** Verification defensibility before dispatch plus
the plan→execute transition are the composer problems agentic-craft works on.
Contract read-back is no longer the main problem.

| ID | Question | Resolution |
|----|----------|------------|
| **A** | Level selection legibility at Send | **Resolved as design position** — level ships as a behavioral badge ("Asks first" / "Edits freely" / "On its own"), never a numbered L0–L5 control |
| **B** | Verification defensibility before dispatch | **Chosen** — surface missing proof, unclear stopping conditions, missing scope, cost/budget ambiguity, and risky actions before Send |
| **C** | Plan→execute transition | **Chosen** — complex tasks gate on plan review, then explicitly pick execution posture |

Canonical vocabulary (three postures, five defensibility gaps) lives in
`src/views/patterns/dispatch-moment-data.ts`; the pattern page at
[`/patterns/dispatch-moment`](../app/(reference)/patterns/dispatch-moment/page.tsx)
is the reference sketch. `docs/research.md` §4.5 carries the reframe.

**Bare/B/C/D stay retired** unless B+C work surfaces a concrete need for a
contract-variant comparison.

**Framework warning:** Three different L0–L5 definitions exist. Anchor on the **July 2026 Gas Town / agency×orchestration post**, not the contract paragraph alone.

## Research consensus (July 3 web subagents)

- No product ships L0–L5 as a numbered control at Send
- At Send: mode/model/placement visible; Run Mode, sandbox, allowlists, stopping conditions often hidden
- Strongest pre-dispatch patterns: **plan gates that also pick execution posture**
- Mid-run switching works (`Shift+Tab`, `Ctrl+L`) but **orthogonal dials** confuse (interaction mode vs permission mode vs Run Mode)
- Factory's split (interaction mode vs autonomy level) is clearest mental model; Cursor's split (chat mode vs Run Mode in Settings) is main failure mode

## Two composers in play

| Name | Location | API shape | Purpose |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Registry composer** | `src/components/ui/composer.tsx` | Provider + islands (`ComposerScope`, `ComposerPlan`, …) | Pattern demos, shadcn registry install |
| **Compound composer** (eve-chat) | [`references/eve-chat/compound-composer/`](../references/eve-chat/compound-composer/) | `Composer.Root` / `Frame` / `Input` / `Footer` / `Controls` / `Submit` | Framework-agnostic dispatch input; slot composition |

These are **different primitives**. The compound composer is snapshotted here as **`compound-composer`** to avoid colliding with the registry `composer` item. Promoting compound parts (`Composer.Receipt`, `Composer.Scope`, …) into the registry — if ever — should stay opt-in compound parts, never boolean props.

## eve-chat proving ground (five-surface model)

Guiding architecture from eve-chat `AGENTS.md`:

1. **Agent Thread** — transcript, streaming, turn anchoring
2. **Agent Composer** — pre-dispatch input (compound primitive)
3. **Run Panel** — Plan / Activity / Sources / Summary (during run)
4. **Human Gate** — intervention outside composer
5. **Review Surface** — post-run outcomes

**Composer belongs before authorization; Run Panel belongs after.** Contract read-back was framed as composer-shaped because it's the PR-create moment, not the activity feed.

Full inventory: [`references/eve-chat/README.md`](../references/eve-chat/README.md).

## Composer lab: Bare / B / C / D (superseded framing)

Built in Claude Code session `dfcc806d` as **playground-only** integrator composition around compound composer slots — primitive untouched. Variants compared how much **dispatch contract read-back** to show at Send:

| Variant | Bet |
|---------|-----|
| **Bare** | Silent absorption — reflection belongs elsewhere |
| **B** | Tappable receipt alone carries the contract |
| **C** | Only the boundary deserves permanent pixels |
| **D** | Seeing the parse builds trust |

Fixture ask: *"migrate session-chat-page to the shared adapter — don't touch deps, stop when tests pass, keep it under $5"*.

**Note:** Variants were described as live at `/playground/composer` in the Claude session; the committed eve-chat playground (snapshot in `references/eve-chat/playgrounds/`) is the **primitive comparison rig** (controlled/uncontrolled, plus menu, thread fixture) without the Bare/B/C/D picker. Recover variant UI from Claude session `dfcc806d` if needed — but **reframe first**.

## User preferences (carry forward)

- Shape content together; don't throw finished drafts
- Long-term goal: public framework for agentic interface design; agentic-craft is proving ground / content mine
- eve-chat is template/proving ground, not the product

---

## Next steps in agentic-craft

1. ~~Choose composer problem **A**, **B**, or **C**~~ — **done 2026-07-05:** B + C chosen (see decision record above); [`/patterns/dispatch-moment`](../app/(reference)/patterns/dispatch-moment/page.tsx) sketches B+C on the registry composer
2. Sketch against registry composer demos and/or compound-composer slots — not contract read-back
3. ~~Cross-check [`docs/research.md`](../docs/research.md) §4~~ — **done 2026-07-05:** §4.5 carries the reframe (behavioral badge, defensibility at Send)
4. Wire the compound-composer playground at `/playground/compound-composer` (URL-only lab; don't fork registry composer) — icons injectable per consumer shadcn config, `attachment` added via CLI
